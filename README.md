# Pac-Man on 16x16 RGB LED Matrix

This project brings the classic Pac-Man game to life on a compact 16x16 RGB LED matrix using Arduino. It demonstrates fun game animation and color handling on limited resolution displays.

## Features

- Pac-Man movement and animation on a 16x16 RGB matrix
- Runs on Arduino-compatible boards with RGB LED matrix support
- Demonstrates frame buffer control and color rendering

## Components Needed

- Arduino Uno/Nano or similar
- 16x16 RGB LED Matrix (WS2812-based recommended)
- Power supply (capable of driving the matrix)
- Jumper wires

## How to Use

1. Connect your RGB matrix to the Arduino as per pin configuration in code.
2. Open and upload the `16pacman.ino` file to your Arduino.
3. Power the LED matrix and enjoy the Pac-Man animation!

> Tip: Adjust matrix layout in code if your matrix has serpentine layout or different orientation.
